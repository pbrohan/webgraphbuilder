<h1>How does the maps page decide what data you've entered?</h1>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check the list of Ecodes for duplicates</strong> If there are any, throw an error</li>
<li><strong>Check the list of Ecodes for districts or counties</strong> If both are found, throw an error. If one is found but the user has selected the other (e.g. if the ecode for a district is in the list but the user has selected &quot;Counties&quot;) select the correct option</li>
<li><strong>Check the list of Ecodes against the list of correct Ecodes for the level</strong> If any non-blank rows contain an unrecognised Ecode, throw an error</li>
<li><strong>Check the data column for numbers</strong> If every row is a number or blank, use a continuous scale, and render the graph, otherwise keep checking</li>
<li><strong>Count the number of unique values</strong> If there are more than 7, throw an error</li>
<li><strong>Check if the user has indicated that the values are ordered</strong> The order is assumed to be the order in which each unique value first appears. Set the palette to shades of the colour selected and render the graph. Otherwise</li>
<li>Set the palette to the default palette for the selected department and render the graph.</li>
</ol>
